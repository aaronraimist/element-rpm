This github repository used to also include `.src.rpm` files (source packages
or SRPMS). These were provided as a convenience. Unfortunately—and
understandably—GitHub has introduced storage and bandwidth quotas that make
maintaining source and binary builds in a github repository an untenable
luxury.

Today, this repository only houses only source packages that exist no where
else and are complimentary to the larger project.

Everything needed to build packages for this application is included in this
repository and upstream repositories. If you can navigate a `.spec` file, you
should know what you need to do.
